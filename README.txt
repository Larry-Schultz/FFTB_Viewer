This is the backend and frontend code for FFTBView.

The backend is written using Java with the Spring Boot Framework.  Database calls are handled by Hibernate, wrapped with Spring JPA.  HTML files are generated using templates with the Thymeleaf library.

The frontend is written in Javascript using primarily JQuery.  I use the Foundation Framework to handle the styling.
